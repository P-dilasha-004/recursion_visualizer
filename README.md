## Features

- Built-in recursive examples:
  - Factorial
  - Fibonacci
- Support for custom user-defined recursive functions
- Step-by-step execution of recursive calls
- Dynamic call stack visualization
- Inline display of the function's source code
- Smooth animations implemented using the Web Animations API
